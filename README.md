Front-End Automated Test


Imagine a tool that tests your WEB UI without using any programming language,
just by filling a Excel spreadsheet about what you want to test and the expected results,
besides it generates all the snapshot of what was tested.


Cool, hmm? Yes, that's what this project is about. It's not finished yet,
not ready to go.


I need to organize the code before showing you, devs. I am embarrassed to show it as is.
